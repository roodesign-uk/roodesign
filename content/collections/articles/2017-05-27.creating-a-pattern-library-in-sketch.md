        text: 'I don’t think it''s hyperbole to say that there’s a revolution happening in the design of digital products. Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.'

These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.'

        text: 'Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, it''s obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS. There is a way of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, the web and iOS have the same features but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.'
