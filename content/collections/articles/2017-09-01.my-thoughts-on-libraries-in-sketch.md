But it’s not cheap, and had always felt like a bit of a stop-gap. The most obvious place for shared symbols has always been within Sketch itself.'

        text: 'After playing with the beta it''s immediately obvious how useful this will be with minimum change to our workflow. No more two-step publishing; making changes to the master sketch library file, then exporting to brand.ai. Now we simply have to save the master file and all users are alerted to the update. We can simply remove brand.ai from the process. Nice.'

However, Abstract uses filename\_"

        text: 'Which is excellent news. But does lead to another thought: Maybe we should start publishing versions of the pattern library. That is, once changes have been made, reviewed and approved in Abstract, we then “publish” a new version to a shared drive. Maybe this workflow would give us greater control over what’s in everyone’s shared libraries, so we’re guaranteed to all be designing with the same set of elements.'
