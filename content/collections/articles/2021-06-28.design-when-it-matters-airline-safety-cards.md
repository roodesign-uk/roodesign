        text: 'In the early days, safety cards were little more than adverts for the airline. Enter two fellas called Dan Johnson and Beau Altman, who worked with Douglas Aircraft to understand crash survivability. Dan and Beau ran frightening-sounding escape simulations with participants of all ages (yes, even kids) to discover how to increase air crash survivability.'

        text: 'Back in the 60s, safety cards had improved somewhat. They were still mostly text, but there were at least some pictures. However, they showed generic cabin objects. So if you saw a picture of a door handle, it probably wouldn''t be the same as the one in your plane. They were printed in a bunch of languages and spiral-bound. Meaning you''d have to flick through to find the bit related to your aircraft in a language you could read. Not ideal for quickly digesting information.'
