To further complicate things, if a user hadn’t supplied bank details, HMRC had to send a cheque. Combined, telephone support and cheques cost HMRC around £1M a year. The business objective, naturally, was to reduce these costs.'

            text: 'Thanks to the Making Tax Digital programme, VAT payers were now submitting tax returns from MTD compatible software. We thought it probable that people would want to see any repayments progress in the same place, too. We thought providing an API would be an ideal addition to any service hosted on GOV.UK. The business agreed but proposed funding the API work as part of a possible second phase.'
